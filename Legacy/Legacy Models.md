# Legacy Models

These models are no longer what I would consider to be the best I have to offer. But if you'd like to give them a try, you can still find them here!

### **HD/FHD Sources - Ani4K \[Gen 5, Compact\]**

\[Gen 5, Compact\] As the name suggests, Ani4K is trained to create natural-looking 2K/4K upscales from 720p/1080p sources. In particular, the model has superb detail retention.

    - [General Comparison](https://imgsli.com/MTg2ODI2)
- **Detail Retention**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Compression Cleanup**: ⭐⭐(will deal with compression in HD/FHD BD and WEB sources without a hitch, but may be less suited for DVDs-- I'll be releasing separate models for DVDs)

### **Legacy Model - AniScaleV1 \[Gen 1, Compact\]**

My very first publicly released model. I consider it obsolete at this point, but some people might prefer the sharper look, so I'm releasing it here as well. As a first generation model, I trained AniScale to serve as a general-purpose model for all sources. Unfortunately, it simply isn't possible to have a single model do everything well-- subsequent generations of models are more specialized, and will do better for the sources they specialize in. While the model is great with details and dealing with a variety of video artifacts, it has a tendency to oversharpen some sources and background details. It doesn't handle blur at all either, though that's a problem common with many other anime models.
