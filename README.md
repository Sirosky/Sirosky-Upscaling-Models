# Sirosky's Upscaling Models

A repository containing upscaling models I created for public use. The models are split into "Generations". Subsequent generations are generally better, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and some people might prefer the look of one model over another. Thus, I opted to release all my models. Currently, there are only 2x models for anime, but I plan on training models for RL footage at some point as well.

If you are just looking for the sharpest possible upscaling model, my models probably won't be of interest. But if you're looking for models trained with a focus on the faithful reproduction of the video and images being upscaled, then have a gander.
